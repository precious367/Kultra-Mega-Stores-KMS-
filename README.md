## CAPSTONE SQL PROJECT
### Topic: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory
This project is aimed at analyzing order data from 2009 to 2012 to uncover key insights on sales, customers, and operations. Using SQL, I identified patterns and provided actionable recommendations to support better business decisions.
### Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this project is KMS SQL Case Study.csv, provided by The Incubator Hub. I downloaded it from the class Canvas platform as part of the capstone project and final exam for the Data Analysis program.
### Tools Used
- Ms Excel For data collection and cleaning
- SQL Server ( for Querying and Analysis)

### Insights and Recommendations
1. Top-Selling Product Category
The Technology category had the highest sales (about ₦5.9 million).
Recommendation: Tech products clearly perform well—marketing should focus more on them. We can also bundle accessories with them to increase order value.

2. Regional Performance
Best-performing regions were west, ontario, pararie. The lowest were Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon.
Recommendation: We should look into why some regions are underperforming. It could be delivery issues, lack of demand, or poor distribution. Running targeted campaigns or partnering with local distributors might help.

3. Product Sales by Region
For example, Appliances alone generated about ₦202,347 in Ontario.
Recommendation: We can use this insight to run regional promotions and make sure our supply chain supports demand in top regions.

4. High Delivery Costs
Delivery truck method had the highest shipping cost overall.
Recommendation: Use delivery trucks mainly for low-priority shipments. For high or critical orders, use faster delivery to keep customers happy and reduce return rates.

5. High-Value Customers
People like Keith Dawkins, Helen Wasserman, and Emily Phan contributed a lot to revenue—mostly buying tech products.
Recommendation: We should recognize and retain these customers with special offers, early access deals, or better customer support.

6. Small Business Sales Opportunity
Dennis Kane, a small business customer, made around ₦75.9K in purchases.
Recommendation: There’s a real opportunity here. Let’s attract more small businesses with discounts on bulk orders or set up recurring supply packages.

7. Corporate Order Volume
Roy Skaria placed 773 orders—the highest in the data.
Recommendation: If we understand Roy’s buying pattern, we could apply the same strategy to reach other similar corporate customers.

8. Most Profitable Consumer was Emily Phan
Recommendation: Her order habits can guide how we upsell or cross-sell to other profitable customers.

9. Returned Orders
About 419 customers returned items across different categories.
Recommendation: We need to understand why—maybe product issues or wrong expectations. Let’s work on clearer descriptions and better packaging.

10. Order Priority vs Shipping Cost
Delivery trucks, though cost-effective, appear to have been used for high and critical priority orders. This might negatively impact customer satisfaction.
Recommendation: Set clear rules to ensure that critical orders are shipped via Express Air.

### Business Impact
If these suggestions are followed:
- Customers will likely be happier.
- We can cut down on costs by using the right shipping method for each type of order.
- There’s a chance to boost revenue by focusing on customers and regions that aren’t performing well.
- Marketing and sales can be more focused and get better results by using what the data shows.

 Conclusion
This project shows that technology products sell really well, especially in places like Ontario. It also shows that most sales are coming from just a few regions and categories. That means we can focus our time, money, and energy on what’s already working.
Another thing we noticed is that delivery trucks are used a lot—even for urgent orders. That might slow things down and affect how customers feel.
Overall, these insights can help KMS make better choices—whether it’s keeping loyal customers happy or finding smarter ways to reach the ones we’re not connecting with yet.
